Homework4

In Homework 4, I created a timed quiz. I made a quiz of 5 multiple choice questions about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Once the start quiz button is click a timer will countdown. When the timer reaches zero an alert will appear and say the game is over. At the end you will be able to input your initials. There is a link at the top left to view the highscores.
